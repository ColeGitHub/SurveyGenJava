CS350 Homework 2

Note: This submission is late.  I ran into issues using Serializable due 
to a simple omission of the "implements" call on objects, and a failure
to return a survey or test in one of the menu methods.  Matching and 
Ranking answers accept strings with no spaces as the input.  

Included are two demo files for a test and a survey.

What's broken: 
Short Answer prints "null" as the correct answer when displaying a test.
